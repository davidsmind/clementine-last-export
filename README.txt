This tool allows you import playcounts from last.fm or libre.fm to update your clementine database.


IMPORTANT: It needs to be run with Clementine closed (if it is not the case Clementine may raise some error while trying to reach its database).

This tool is working on Linux and may work also on Mac and Windows but wasn't tested on these OS. 

For more information on how to use it, see the wiki section on its github page: https://github.com/davidsmind/clementine-last-export

Feel free to give me any feedback: davidsmind@davidsmind.com or on the github
