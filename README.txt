This tool allows you import playcounts from last.fm to update your clementine database.

As it works outside of Clementine it needs to be run with Clementine closed (if it is not the case Clementine may raise some error while trying to reach its database).

This tool is working on Linux and may work also on Mac and Windows but wasn't tested on these OS. For more information on how to use it, see the wiki section on its github page.

Feel free to give me any feedback, either on its github page: https://github.com/davidsmind/clementine-last-export 

I forked this from http://github.com/werdeil/clementine-last-export/ when
pyqt4 stopped being supported by most Linux Operating Systems
