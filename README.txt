This tool allows you import playcounts from last.fm to update your clementine database.

This is a temporary solution until Issue 90 of the Clementine project is implemented. As it works outside of Clementine it needs to be run with Clementine closed (if it is not the case Clementine may raise some error while trying to reach its database).

This tool is working on Linux and may work also on Mac and Windows but wasn't tested on these OS. For more information on how to use it, see the wiki section on its code google page.

Feel free to give me any feedback, either on its code google page: http://code.google.com/p/clementine-last-export/ or directly by mail (vincent.verdeilATgmailDOTcom)
